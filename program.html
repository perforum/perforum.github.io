	  <i>Strategic use of emotional signals in bonobos increases bystander empathy</i><br>
		<details>
		<summary>abstract</summary>
		Tactical emotion communication has long been considered unique feature of human communication. As a species, we readily exaggerate, inhibit and modify emotional expressions according to social context and audience. Notably, emitting emotional displays, such as those pertaining to distress states, can evoke empathic responses in others such as the offering of consolation to victims after a fight. Animal emotion expressions, by contrast, are traditionally viewed as uncontrollable arousal responses. Our study challenges this view by assessing the level of control in the emotional signalling of sanctuary-living bonobo victims following aggressive attacks (N = 27 victims, N = 144 attacks) and its and its corresponding effect on receivers. Results show that the production of paedomorphic signals by adult bonobo victims increased chances of receiving consolation from bystanders and reduced risk of future aggression from former opponents, highlighting a strategic function. Victim signalling also increased with audience size, yet strategies differed by age: immature bonobos were more likely to cease signalling in proximity of close-social partners, whereas adults were more likely to cease signalling only after having been consoled. These data suggest that bonobo emotion communication has a developmental trajectory and that tactical emotion signalling is a <i>Pan-human</i> capacity, preceding the split of <i>Homo</i>.

	  <i>The indexical view of affective expressivity</i><br>
		<details>
		<summary>abstract</summary>
		Research on affective meaning has produced models that integrate the affective aspects of curse words such as 'damn' in a compositional framework (e.g., Potts 2005, 2007). However, there is extensive evidence that curse words cannot be assigned a single or stable affective interpretation across contexts (Jay 2000, McCready 2012). For instance, even though expletive adjectives (e.g.,'damn'), particularistic insults (e.g., 'bastard') and slurs (e.g., 'faggot') typically express (and elicit) negatively valenced affective states, they can also be interpreted positively in some contexts. Thus, inspired on recent developments in formal sociolinguistics (Burnett 2017, 2019), I propose a indexical approach to affective meaning. Under this approach, an affective expression is associated with a set of affective qualities, anyone of which may emerge at a given contexts depending on the interpreter's prior assumptions about the speaker's affective predispositions. In other terms, I will defend the idea that affective expressions, and in particular curse words, are interpreted depending on the expression's stereotypical interpretation and what is assumed about the speaker's affective predispositions at a given context.

	  <i>Performativity and Referentiality in Multilingual Poetry</i><br>
		<details>
		<summary>abstract</summary>
		Danish poet Shadi Angelina Bazeghi writes in more than six different languages in her activist poetry collection <i>Flowmatic</i> (2020). While some of these languages will be immediately understandable or at least recognizable to Danish readers, such as Danish, English, German and Swedish, others, such as transcribed Persian and Arabic, will not. Yet, if most readers do not understand Persian and Arabic, what do these languages do in the poem? In my talk I will consider what functions of referentiality and performativity are at work when the reader is confronted with text in Persian or Arabic in <i>Flowmatic</i>. In the strictest sense, these parts of the poem become nonsensical, however, they could be thought of as a provocative way of addressing and engaging the reader in ways that transgress meaning as referentiality.

	  <i>From compassion to being moved: Social emotions evoked by music</i>
	    <details>
		<summary>abstract</summary>
		Music is an inherently social phenomenon. Even when we listen to music in solitude, social cognitive processes play an important role in shaping our perception and experience. One example of such a process is the feeling of 'being moved'&mdash;a powerful, rewarding experience often accompanied by chills, tears, and a sense of connection. Building on empirical evidence from my recent work, I will argue that experiences of 'being moved' in the context of music listening are inherently social responses. I will demonstrate that feelings of being moved are closely related to empathic personality traits and feelings of compassion, and they mediate the enjoyment of music-induced sadness. I will also argue that feeling moved by music is associated with appraisals or experiences of closeness or affiliation.
